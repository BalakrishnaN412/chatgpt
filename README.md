# QuizMaster Pro

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for the QuizMaster Pro platform.

- `backend` - Spring Boot application with a sample REST endpoint and a simple
  PostgreSQL-backed `User` API.
- `frontend` - React + TypeScript application with a basic entry point and a
  form to add and list users.
Both modules are placeholders for future development.

## Development Status

### Completed Pages
- Basic user list and creation form in the React frontend interacting with the `User` API.

### Pages to Develop
- Public: Landing, Authentication (login/register), Pricing.
- Admin: Dashboard, User Management, Category Management, Question Bank, Exam Creation, Results & Analytics.
- User: Exam Portal, Exam Interface, Results page.

This list follows the high-level requirements for QuizMaster Pro and will expand as the platform evolves.
