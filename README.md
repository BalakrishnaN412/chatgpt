# QuizMaster Pro

This repository contains a minimal skeleton for the QuizMaster Pro platform.

- `backend` - Spring Boot application with a sample REST endpoint and a simple
  PostgreSQL-backed `User` API.
- `frontend` - React + TypeScript application with a basic entry point and a
  form to add and list users.

Both modules are placeholders for future development.
